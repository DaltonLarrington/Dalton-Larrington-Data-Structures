# We know there needs to be 6 exam rooms
# Each patient will need to be in the exam room for about 17.5 minutes
# Each patient can enter the waiting room twice
# There can be about 3.43 patients per exam room per hour
# There can be about 24 patients per hour
# Therefore there needs to be 6 doctors

##Waiting Room

def waitingRoom():
    
    keep track of number of patients in waitingRoom
    
##Patient

def patient():

    pat = patient

    set timer of each patient to a random between 15-20 minutes

    then remove patient from simulation     

##Nurse

def nurse():

    check for number of open examRoom
    
    if examRoom >= 1:

        then send patient in waitingRoom to examRoom

##Exam Room

def examRoom():

    rooms = 6

    take 6 patients from waitingRoom    

##Physican
    
def physican():

    doctors = 6

    subtract the number of doctors with the number of patients in examRoom
